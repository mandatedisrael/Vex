/**
 * `shellBridge` — preload-side composer for vex-app desktop integration.
 *
 * Imports each shell-domain bridge as a named export, builds a single
 * object that `satisfies VexShellBridge`, and re-exports it for the
 * root composer (`preload/index.ts`) to fold into `window.vex`.
 *
 * Explicit named imports + `satisfies` keep the surface tight:
 *
 *   - the type guard catches missing namespaces (compile error if a
 *     domain is added to `VexShellBridge` but not wired here),
 *   - a stray module-level value from any child file cannot become a
 *     bridge namespace by accident,
 *   - call-sites stay grep-friendly (no `export *` in the tree).
