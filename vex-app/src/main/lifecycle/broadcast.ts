/**
 * Broadcast a payload to every live BrowserWindow's webContents.
 *
 * Centralizes the `getAllWindows() → isDestroyed() → webContents.send`
 * loop that was previously copy-pasted at three IPC handler sites
 * (docker install progress, compose logs, database migration progress).
 * Per skill §11, the destroyed-window guard is mandatory — sending to
 * a destroyed webContents throws and bypasses the cleanup registry.
 *
 * Channel string is opaque to this helper; callers must use the typed
 * `EV.<domain>.<topic>` constants from `@shared/ipc/channels.js`.
