/**
 * Sync-executor worker ownership (F11).
 *
 * Electron main owns the engine's sync executor so post-mutation
 * `protocol_sync_runs` actually drain into refreshed portfolio/balance
 * projections — without this, every mutating protocol tool enqueues a run that
 * sits `pending` forever and the renderer shows stale balances/positions.
 *
 * Unlike the compact and wake workers, the sync executor has NO provider gate:
 * it makes no OpenRouter/inference calls. What it DOES do is PUBLIC-ADDRESS
 * NETWORK READS — `initSync()` snapshots balances and `syncTick()` refreshes
 * projections by querying Khalani/Jupiter/Polymarket with the wallet's PUBLIC
 * addresses. No keystore unlock and no private key are involved. The only start
 * gate is this SUPERVISOR proving Postgres + the `protocol_sync_jobs` schema are
 * ready (not merely that `VEX_DB_URL` resolves). Consequence: once the schema is
 * ready the executor can start BEFORE the vault is unlocked, so public-address
 * network egress may begin pre-unlock — an accepted privacy trade-off (the
 * addresses are public; no secret material is touched).
 *
 * Lifecycle mirrors `wake-worker.ts`: tick immediately then every
 * `SUPERVISOR_INTERVAL_MS` until the DB is ready, then start the executor
 * EXACTLY ONCE and clear the interval (the executor self-schedules thereafter).
 * `stop()` is non-reentrant and idempotent: clears the interval, awaits any
 * in-flight startup tick, and stops the executor if started — a probe/import
 * that resolves AFTER quit begins must NOT leave a live executor.
 *
 * `stop()` is sequenced BEFORE compose/Postgres teardown via
 * `makeOrderedQuitCleanup` in `index.ts`, so an in-flight tick drains against a
 * live DB.
