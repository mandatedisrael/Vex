 * Shared reasoning-capability resolver (S6/D3/D7) — the ONE fallback chain
 * both `models.ts` (global model list) and `sessions/get-model.ts`
 * (per-session echo of the same global model) use to resolve
 * `ModelOptionDto.reasoning` / `SessionModelDto.reasoning`. Extracted out of
 * `sessions/get-model.ts` (its original owner) so a single tested resolver
 * backs both IPC channels instead of two independently-maintained copies —
 * the drift pin test in `ipc-handler-surface/models-sessions.test.ts`
 * asserts both channels return identical capability for the same model id.
 *
 * Fallback chain (D3, in order):
 *  1. Capability entry exists, `reasoning` non-null → return it verbatim,
 *     `supportsReasoning: true`.
 *  2. Capability entry exists, `reasoning` null → boolean-only
 *     `supportsReasoning` from `supportsReasoningParameter`, `reasoning: null`
 *     (no selector — nothing to select from).
 *  3. Capability entry absent (fetch failed, or the model isn't in the
 *     catalog) → fall back to the pre-S6 pricing-proxy probe for
 *     `supportsReasoning` only; `reasoning` stays `null`.
