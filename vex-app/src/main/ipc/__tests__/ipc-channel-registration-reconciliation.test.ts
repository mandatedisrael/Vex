/**
 * IPC channel ↔ register-all reconciliation guard (grounding item B-009).
 *
 * The IPC surface is a renderer→main trust boundary. Two kinds of drift are
 * silent failures that this guard turns into a red test:
 *
 *  1. A request channel constant is declared in `channels.ts` (CH) but no
 *     main handler is registered for it. The renderer can then call a dead
 *     channel that `ipcRenderer.invoke` leaves pending forever (no
 *     `ipcMain.handle` responder). Every such channel MUST be either wired
 *     to a handler OR listed in the reserved allowlist below with a comment
 *     explaining why it is intentionally unimplemented.
 *
 *  2. A handler is registered with a raw `ipcMain.handle(...)` call instead
 *     of going through `registerHandler` in `register-handler.ts`. That
 *     bypasses sender validation, payload/output Zod validation, the
 *     redacted `VexError` shape, correlation IDs, and the cancel registry —
 *     the entire main-side boundary enforcement. The only legitimate raw
 *     `ipcMain.handle` lives in `register-handler.ts`; everything else must
 *     route through it.
 *
 * Mechanism notes:
 *
 *  - The "actually registered" set is captured by a STATIC REACHABILITY scan
 *    rooted at `register-all.ts`. A runtime spy on `ipcMain.handle` driven by
 *    `registerAllIpcHandlers()` was the first design, but importing the full
 *    registration graph in a unit harness pulls the entire agent/DB/wallet/
 *    Docker dependency tree (it does not settle in a unit test). The static
 *    scan reproduces what the runtime would register, deterministically and
 *    with no import side effects.
 *
 *  - A NAIVE static scan of EVERY main source file for `channel: CH...` is
 *    NOT sufficient: a handler module that declares `registerHandler({ channel:
 *    CH.foo.bar })` but whose `register*Handlers()` function is never called by
 *    `registerAllIpcHandlers()` would still be counted as registered, even
 *    though the renderer's `invoke` for that channel hangs forever at runtime
 *    (no `ipcMain.handle` responder is ever installed). That is the EXACT
 *    failure this guard must catch. So the registered set is computed from
 *    REACHABILITY, not mere declaration:
 *
 *      1. statically parse `register-all.ts` for the `register*`/`setup*`
 *         identifiers actually CALLED inside `registerAllIpcHandlers()`;
 *      2. resolve each called identifier to its source module via the matching
 *         `import { … } from "…"` statement in `register-all.ts`;
 *      3. transitively walk the static relative-import/export graph from those
 *         seed modules (facade shims like `runtime.ts` re-export a `./runtime/
 *         index.ts` barrel which imports the per-handler modules — the walk
 *         follows that chain);
 *      4. scan ONLY the reachable modules for the `channel:` argument passed to
 *         `registerHandler(...)` and resolve it against `CH`.
 *
 *    A channel declared in a module that is NOT reachable from `register-all.ts`
 *    therefore counts as UNREGISTERED — the reconciliation FAILS for it (unless
 *    it is in the reserved allowlist). The mutation test below proves this:
 *    excluding a seed (simulating a `register*Handlers()` that is never called)
 *    flips that subtree's channels to unregistered.
 *
 *    Dynamic `import()` calls in handler modules all target aliased packages
 *    (`@vex-agent/*`, `@shared/*`), never relative paths, so they are correctly
 *    NOT walked — and none of those targets declare request channels.
 *
 *  - The raw-handler scan (concern #2) independently proves no handler can
 *    register OUTSIDE `registerHandler` — so the reachability scan and the
 *    raw-handler scan together pin the same invariant a runtime spy would.
 *
 *  - Push channels (`vex:event:*`) and stream channels (`vex:stream:*`) are
 *    EXCLUDED from the request reconciliation — they are `webContents.send`
 *    broadcasts, not `ipcMain.handle` request/response responders. `CH`
 *    currently holds only request channels (events live in `EV`), but the
 *    filter is defensive against a future event constant landing in `CH`.
