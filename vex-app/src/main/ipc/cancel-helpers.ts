/**
 * Helpers for the cancellation contract introduced in PR3.
 *
 * - `raceWithAbort`: returns the input promise's resolution unless the
 *   provided `AbortSignal` aborts first, in which case rejects with an
 *   AbortError. Always cleans up the abort listener on every exit
 *   path (resolve, reject, abort) to avoid leaking listeners on the
 *   shared controller — which matters for the compose-up single-flight
 *   join path, where many joined waiters may attach to the same shared
 *   promise.
 *
 * - `isAbortError`: best-effort check for "this rejection came from an
 *   aborted signal". Node + the DOM both use `error.name === "AbortError"`,
 *   but we also accept anything that already implements that shape.
 *
 * - `cancelledError`: factory for the `internal.cancelled` VexError.
 *   Centralised so every cancellation surface returns the same shape
 *   (and the same user-facing message).
 *
 * These helpers are unit-testable in isolation — no Electron, no IPC.

 * floor (we never see it; it does NOT block GC).
 *
 * If `signal` is undefined, this is a transparent pass-through.
 *
 * Critically: this does NOT call `controller.abort()` on the upstream
 * promise's source. It only stops awaiting. Compose-up joined callers
 * use this to detach from the shared in-flight promise without
 * aborting the shared process — only the initiator's signal flows
 * into `runSpawn`.
