 * the FINAL selectable set (or `null` when there is nothing to select).
 *
 * `raw === undefined` means the model's `reasoning` key was absent upstream
 * entirely (non-reasoning model) — no selector, independent of anything
 * below. When `raw` IS present, `supportedEfforts` has 3 distinct upstream
 * states (D3, verbatim):
 *  - OMITTED (`undefined`) → `reasoning: null`. A `reasoning` object present
 *    without its `supported_efforts` field is treated conservatively as "we
 *    don't actually know the selectable set", NOT as "no restriction" —
 *    that stronger claim is reserved for an EXPLICIT `null`.
 *  - `null` → the full POSITIVE canonical set (OpenRouter's own
 *    "no restriction" signal).
 *  - array → D4-set below.
 *
 * Steps for the array/null case (mirror the plan's D4-set algorithm):
 *  1. Positive efforts in provider order — `supportedEfforts: null` uses the
 *     canonical order; an explicit array preserves upstream order.
 *  2. Drop "none" and unrecognized values from that list, then dedupe
 *     (first occurrence wins).
 *  3. If the positive set is empty (empty array / all-unknown /
 *     ["none"]-only) → whole capability normalizes to `null` (never an
 *     Off-only selector).
 *  4. `mandatory` → "none" is NEVER appended, even when upstream's raw
 *     array inconsistently lists it (mandatory strips it regardless).
 *     Otherwise append EXACTLY ONE "none" (Off).
 *  5. `defaultEffort` is clamped to the FINAL set — an upstream default
 *     that isn't a member (e.g. mandatory + `default_effort: "none"`)
 *     normalizes to `null` rather than surfacing an invalid default.
