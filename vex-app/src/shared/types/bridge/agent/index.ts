/**
 * `VexAgentBridge` — vex-agent runtime integration surface.
 *
 * Aggregates the 9 agent-side domain bridges: sessions, chat,
 * messages, runtime control plane, mission contract/commands,
 * approvals queue, per-session wallet scope, model catalogue, and
 * usage meter. These flows belong to the `vex-agent/` runtime, even
 * though their handlers live inside Electron main with their own
 * decoupled DB clients.
 *
 * Re-exports each domain interface explicitly (no `export *`) so the
 * surface stays searchable and a stray declaration in a child module
 * cannot grow the public type by accident.
