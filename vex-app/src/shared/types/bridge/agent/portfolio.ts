/**
 * Portfolio — read-only wallet-scoped reads (stage 3 + move 0.3 + chronos-shell).
 *
 * `read` resolves a server-side wallet address allow-list (the configured
 * inventory for `{ scope: "global" }`, or the session's wallet scope for
 * `{ scope: "session", sessionId }`) and aggregates `proj_balances` +
 * `proj_portfolio_snapshots` into a renderer-safe DTO. An empty allow-list
 * resolves to the empty portfolio DTO, never an error.
 *
 * `listMoves` resolves the session's wallet scope and reads its executed-trade
 * activity from `proj_activity` (the MOVES feed — real swaps, success-only by
 * construction). An empty scope resolves to the empty array, never an error.
 *
 * `listTokenHistory` resolves the GLOBAL configured wallet inventory (same
 * allow-list as `read`'s `scope: "global"`) and reads one token's full
 * activity + executed-transfer history, keyset-paginated. A `{status:
 * "unavailable"}` DTO is a genuine degraded-success shape (the read hit its
 * bounded statement timeout) — never an error `Result`.
 *
 * The renderer never supplies a wallet address.
