/**
 * Shell design-language guard — THE SIGNAL DESK (landing rebrand) stays
 * locked.
 *
 * The shell's visual law (globals.css `[data-vex-shell]` scope): the
 * projectvex.ai landing DNA on ink surfaces — depth is solid luminance +
 * hairlines, never glass or resting glow; one accent family (the landing
 * cobalt #1f44ff via the --vex-accent tokens) and ZERO raw legacy hexes;
 * no ShinyText gradient chrome. The only sanctioned gradient is the
 * `.vex-select-beam` utility (globals.css) — the landing's selected-item
 * beam. This test turns each law into a red build instead of a review
 * comment:
 *
 *   1. /backdrop-blur(?!-none)/ — no backdrop-filter glass anywhere in the
 *      shell. `backdrop-blur-none` is EXEMPT by the lookahead (the dialog
 *      base itself is blur-free since the rebrand).
 *   2. /ShinyText|vex-shiny-text/ — the shine chrome died in S7 (component
 *      + @keyframes deleted); nothing may re-import it.
 *   3. the legacy gray-blue hex family + the retired Protocol Desk accent
 *      #3275f8 — replaced by --vex-accent tokens rooted at #1f44ff.
 *   4. /shadow-\[0_0_/ — resting glow. Depth never comes from shadows
 *      (directional shadows and the select-beam's lit-item shadow live in
 *      globals.css, outside this scan by design).
 *
 * Scope: every non-test .ts/.tsx under features/appShell, plus the two
 * shared primitives the shell composes for popover/dialog chrome
 * (components/ui/dialog.tsx, components/ui/select-menu.tsx). Onboarding
 * surfaces are a separate, finished language and are NOT scanned.
 *
 * Sources are read via `import.meta.glob(..., ?raw)` — Vite inlines the
 * file contents at transform time — instead of `node:fs`, so this test
 * typechecks inside the renderer TS project WITHOUT pulling @types/node
 * into the renderer program (the renderer/main type boundary stays clean).
 * A raw text scan (not an AST) is correct here: every banned pattern is a
 * Tailwind class fragment or hex literal that can only appear as text.
