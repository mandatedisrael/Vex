/**
 * Pure decision logic for an incoming agent workspace-mode request. Kept free

 * Rule (product-locked):
 *  - `mode: "normal"`               → leave the mode (exit).
 *  - `mode: "hypervexing"`, acked   → enter the mode (play the transition).
 *  - `mode: "hypervexing"`, NOT acked → show the first-entry risk acknowledgment
 *    FIRST; the mode activates only after the user accepts. Real leverage on
 *    real funds is not entered by surprise.
