/**
 * Glass zone shell for the Hypervexing grid (design spec §13.1). Every grid
 * slot wears the SAME translucent ink over the Eclipse backdrop, so the room reads
 * as one liquid surface: separation comes from the sky showing through the
 * grid gaps, never from borders drawn between panels.
 *
 * Owner-sanctioned glass (see the design-guard whitelist): the Hypervexing
 * workspace is a sanctioned glass surface family, deliberately scoped to this
 * single wrapper so backdrop-blur cannot leak file-by-file into the normal
 * shell. Zone components render their content only — this wrapper owns the
 * grid placement and the glass chrome.
