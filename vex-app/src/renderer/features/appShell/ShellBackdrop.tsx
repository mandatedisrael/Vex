/**
 * CHRONOS BACKDROP — the shell's back wall: the eclipse-meadow artwork
 * (`public/backdrops/eclipse-meadow.webp`) as a full-window photo layer
 * at z-0.
 *
 * This deliberately supersedes the retired "zero photography" law (the
 * procedural SignalSky WebGL canvas it replaces): the Chronos theme is
 * Focused · Quiet · Precise, and its identity IS this image. The columns
 * float above as glass — the two rails + the composer read the photo
 * through their guard-whitelisted blurred glass surfaces.
 *
 * Owner correction round (2026-07-20): the dither/displacement system this
 * layer used to compose through (`components/ui/dither-image.tsx`, the
 * vendored Tailwind dither plugin) is retired repo-wide — it read as an ugly
 * "frame/grid" texture rather than ambience. The photo is now a PLAIN,
 * unfiltered `<img>`; the Chronos glass grain (`.vex-noise`) lives only on
 * the floating surfaces above, never on the backdrop photo itself.
 *
 * Two layers, both decorative (aria-hidden, pointer-events-none):
 *   1. the photo, object-cover, breathing on the 90s `.vex-backdrop-drift`
 *      scale loop (glacial — no single glance perceives motion; the global
 *      reduced-motion rule stills it);
 *   2. an ink veil (--vex-surface-0) over it, whose opacity carries the
 *      stage state: light on the welcome/idle stage (opacity-30 — the
 *      artwork stays the protagonist), deep behind an active session
 *      transcript (opacity-80 — messages must read clearly). The 900ms
 *      ease-[var(--vex-ease-inout)] keeps the deepen cinematic, not abrupt
 *      (owner decree 2026-07-20).
 *
 * If the image ever fails to load, the shell root's own
 * `bg-[var(--vex-surface-0)]` remains as the canvas — never a white flash.
