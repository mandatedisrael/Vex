/**
 * Motion DNA for the welcome-stage floating Portfolio tab — the same
 * spring/stagger hand as the SidebarProfile menu (SPRING_PANEL carries the
 * surface, EASE_STANDARD cascades the rows), shared between the panel (stack
 * variants) and the cards (each card is a motion child riding
 * `cardVariants`). MOTION-POLICY compliant: only transform/opacity animate;
 * no `layout`/`layoutId` (they inject a runtime stylesheet the CSP bans).
 *
 * The stack's hidden/exit frames translate down and scale toward the round
 * handle button (the panel sets `origin-bottom-right`), so expanding reads
 * as the button growing into the card stack and collapsing as the stack
 * settling back down onto it — one object morphing, never two unrelated
 * elements. The exit is a short tween (not the spring) so the collapse
 * lands without wobble.
