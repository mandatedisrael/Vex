/**
 * WELCOME PORTFOLIO TAB — the right-edge presentation of the BOOK on the
 * welcome stage (no active session; `BookPanel` routes here). Not a rail:
 * a floating, collapsible tab anchored near the lower right edge, driven by
 * the SAME persisted `bookOpen` flag as the session rail, so the user's one
 * choice survives across both stages (welcome floating tab ⇄ session rail).
 *
 *  - `bookOpen === false`: only the round ink handle button.
 *  - `bookOpen === true`: the handle plus a 340px card stack (Portfolio
 *    Overview / Wallets / Balances) expanding UPWARD from the button —
 *    SPRING_PANEL carries the surface, the SidebarProfile-DNA stagger
 *    cascades the cards (see `portfolio-motion.ts`); collapse settles the
 *    stack back down onto the handle. The handle persists in BOTH states as
 *    the anchor of the morph (`origin-bottom-right` on the stack), so the
 *    tab always reads as one object, never two unrelated elements.
 *
 * IN-FLOW like a sidebar (owner correction, 2026-07-20 screenshot review —
 * the earlier absolute overlay ran the cards OVER the hero/composer): the
 * root is an `<aside>` flex sibling in the shell row that RESERVES its
 * width while open (`w-[380px]` = 24px gutter + 340px stack + 16px
 * breathing) and gives it all back when collapsed (`w-0`), animated with
 * the SessionsList width-only transition idiom, so the centered welcome
 * canvas reflows and re-centers instead of being covered. The aside is the
 * row's LAST child — its right edge stays pinned to the window — so the
 * handle, anchored `absolute bottom-[88px] right-6` INSIDE the aside, sits
 * at the same spot in both states. The only transient overlap left is the
 * ~0.15s stack exit fade painting over the re-expanding center — decay,
 * not occlusion. The moment a session materializes the real rail at narrow
 * width, `useAutoCollapseBook`'s stage-aware edge collapses it once.
 *
 * The handle deliberately carries NO glass blur (the design-guard scans raw
 * text, so even naming the banned utility here would redden the build): at
 * 44px the effect is imperceptible, and skipping it keeps the guard's glass
 * whitelist at exactly ONE portfolio file (`PortfolioCard.tsx`); the
 * solid-leaning `--vex-rail-strong` ink reads clean over the Eclipse.
 * Reduced motion is sampled once per mount (SidebarProfile pattern): the
 * stack renders and removes its final frame instantly.
