/**
 * Main app shell — THE SIGNAL DESK, CHRONOS edition (Focused · Quiet ·
 * Precise).
 *
 * Onboarding proved identity in a dark room (one light, one signature);
 * the shell is the working register that signature unlocked. Ink canvas
 * (#0a0d18 via --vex-surface-0), zero resting glow: depth on solid surfaces
 * comes from the three luminance steps defined by the [data-vex-shell]
 * scope in globals.css, separated by hairlines. The one sanctioned gradient
 * is the selection beam (.vex-select-beam).
 *
 * The room's back wall is the Eclipse photo backdrop (ShellBackdrop, z-0 —
 * owner-decreed 2026-07-20, superseding the retired procedural SignalSky
 * and its "zero photography" law), running LIGHT-veiled on the welcome/idle
 * stage and DEEP-veiled behind an active session transcript. The columns
 * float above it: the center section carries `relative z-10`; the two side
 * rails (SessionsList / BookPanel) are guard-whitelisted glass (--vex-rail
 * over a blurred backdrop, no border walls) so the artwork reads through
 * them and the shell stays ONE canvas.
 *
 * Layout: sidebar rail (SessionsList) | session column under the DESK RULE
 * | optional on-demand BOOK panel (right <aside>, gated on bookOpen). The
 * center panel is ALWAYS the session panel (Chronos screens redesign,
 * 2026-07-20): Memory, the sessions library, and "How Vex works" open as
 * full-app ShellScreen overlays (screens/), not center sub-views.
 * The DESK RULE (h-12 header) is a 3-zone grid: the live tape-state word
 * (left), the MISSION/PLAN badge cluster (`MissionRail`, center), and the
 * right flank hosting the approvals inbox (the BOOK toggle + version stamp
 * both live in BookPanel's collapse header — single-toggle owner review).
 * The rule carries no decorative accent tick (owner decree, 2026-07-20: the
 * stray dash read as visual noise, not a landmark).
 *
 * `data-vex-shell="true"` scopes the Protocol Desk tokens (sibling of
 * data-vex-onboarding); `data-vex-screen="appShell"` stays the e2e/test
 * selector. The window keeps its native OS frame, so no -webkit-app-region
 * drag strip is mounted (S0 decision — revisit only if the frame goes
 * custom).
