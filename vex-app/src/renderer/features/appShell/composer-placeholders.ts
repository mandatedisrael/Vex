/**
 * Rotating welcome/agent placeholder for the Signal Console composer.
 *
 * Six crypto orders tied to Vex's real system utilities (swap routing, cross
 * -chain bridge, DexScreener trends, the $VEX token, a gas-watch mission, and
 * a portfolio rebalance) cycle through the DEFAULT composer prompt so the
 * resting instrument suggests what the operator can actually ask for.
 * Copy sweep 2026-07-21 round 2: no phrase may reference the retired Plan
 * Mode ("show the plan first" is gone). Mission-mode placeholders are owned
 * elsewhere (`composer-helpers.placeholderFor`) — this rotator ONLY drives
 * the welcome/agent default.
 *
 * Mechanics mirror the retired welcome TaglineRotator: a ~6s cadence that
 * pauses while the document is hidden (visibilitychange) and never starts
 * under prefers-reduced-motion (the first phrase renders statically, read once
 * at first render — mid-session preference flips are not tracked, same
 * trade-off as the hero rotator). Beyond the hero rotator it ALSO freezes on
 * the current phrase whenever the caller reports the field is engaged (focused
 * or holding a value): the timer stops instead of advancing in the background, so a
 * placeholder never shuffles under an operator mid-thought and rotation
 * resumes on a fresh read window once the field is idle again.
 *
 * This hook only OWNS the current phrase. The soft crossfade between
 * phrases lives in the composer's aria-hidden faux-placeholder overlay
 * (SessionComposer keys a motion span per phrase) — the earlier hard
 * attribute swap was owner-rejected (2026-07-21 round 2).
