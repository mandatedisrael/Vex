/**
 * Reasoning-effort selector (S6/D4) — the composer pill's quiet "Grok slot"
 * control, seated in the right cluster LEFT of the round send key.
 *
 * Presentational only: the parent (SessionComposer) owns the effective
 * selection (the stored per-session pick validated against the model's
 * FINAL selectable set, else the shared TESTED preselect
 * `selectDefaultReasoningEffort`) and the store write — this component
 * never re-derives preselect logic. Options are the DTO's already-
 * normalized `SessionModelDto.reasoning.supportedEfforts` VERBATIM
 * (provider order, exactly one "none" iff the model is not mandatory —
 * `normalizeReasoningCapability` in `shared/schemas/reasoning.ts` owns
 * that set), with "none" labelled "Off".
 *
 * Anatomy: the {@link SelectMenu} primitive restyled into the pill's quiet
 * grammar — a ghost text trigger (no border, no glass at rest; the label in
 * --vex-text-2 lifting to foreground on hover), h-10 so it sits level with
 * the round send key, opening UPWARD (the pill sits low on the session
 * stage). Menu physics, the ARIA combobox/listbox contract and the
 * selected-dot convention all come from SelectMenu as-is. The trigger's
 * min-width doubles as the floating panel's width (SelectMenu's panel spans
 * its trigger), sized so the longest label ("Minimal") never truncates.
