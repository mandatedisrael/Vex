/**
 * Public gate of the wizard feature (Phase 2b — Settings rebuild).
 *
 * The in-shell Settings screen (`features/appShell/screens/SettingsScreen`)
 * hosts the SAME step forms the wizard runs, in `flowMode="back-edit"`
 * semantics. This gate exports exactly what that consumer needs and nothing
 * else — every other module under `features/wizard/` is wizard-internal.
 * Cross-feature imports go through here (rule 04: features reach other
 * features only through public APIs).
