/**
 * Wizard entry routing — the ONE decision table for "what does a launch
 * (or a wizard mount) do with the persisted wizard state + vault status".
 *
 * Extracted from WizardShell's init/completion effects (behavior-preserving,
 * Chronos Gate PR1) so the boot orchestrator (`features/setup/`) and the
 * wizard shell resolve the SAME table instead of duplicating it. Pure —
 * no IPC, no store access; callers fetch `WizardState` + secrets status
 * themselves and hand the facts in.
 *
 * The table (mirrors the pre-extraction WizardShell logic exactly, minus the
 * reconfigure row retired by Decision C — Settings owns back-edit now):
 *   completed + vault locked         → unlock, resume to appShell
 *   completed + vault missing        → show Keystore (repair path)
 *   completed                        → appShell
 *   mid-setup + past keystore + vault locked → unlock, resume to wizard
 *   mid-setup                        → resume persisted step
 *
 * `entryMode` is currently always "setup" (WizardEntryMode is single-valued),
 * but stays in the signature so re-adding a launch mode does not re-wire both
 * consumers.
