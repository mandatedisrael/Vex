/**
 * CURTAIN EXIT — the gate choreography, reused for leaving a pre-shell
 * screen (Phase 2b, owner decree C.3). Today it plays after a successful
 * unlock; it is deliberately presentational so a future finalize exit can
 * reuse it with different wiring.
 *
 * Sequence (the SetupGate curtain in reverse order of duties):
 *   1. COVER — the full-window cobalt plate fades in over the current
 *      screen (0.22s). The plate is pixel-identical to the pre-shell
 *      continuum plate beneath, so only the card content visibly melts
 *      away — the cobalt reads as one continuous surface.
 *   2. `onCovered()` — the caller flips the view machine while the plate
 *      is opaque (nothing beneath is visible); one frame later the reveal
 *      starts.
 *   3. REVEAL — the plate splits into two panels sliding off the top and
 *      bottom edges (`EASE_INOUT` 0.62s, the gate's own curve), unveiling
 *      the new view. `onDone()` unmounts the curtain.
 *
 * No cancel path — mount it only after the triggering IPC has succeeded.
 * Reduced motion: an explicit instant swap (effect-driven, no animation
 * callbacks to rely on) — `onCovered` fires on mount, `onDone` one frame
 * later. Layering: `z-50` like SetupGate, below UpdateLayer's `z-[60]` so
 * an update toast stays visible over the exit ritual.
