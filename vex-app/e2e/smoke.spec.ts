/**
 * PR4 boot smoke — single spec that proves the whole
 * main↔preload↔renderer triangle works against the *built* Electron
 * bundle.
 *
 * What we assert (and why this is enough for a smoke):
 *   1. Electron launches without crashing.
 *   2. The first window opens within the fixture's launch timeout.
 *   3. `window.vex` is bridged through preload (proves the
 *      contextBridge boundary is intact).
 *   4. `window.vex.system.health` is a callable function (proves the
 *      bridged surface matches the `VexBridge` contract — if the
 *      preload `satisfies VexBridge` check ever drifts, this catches
 *      it).
 *   5. The Chronos Gate boot overlay renders first, its orchestrator
 *      runs the launch probes, and — because the per-spec CONFIG_DIR is
 *      fresh (first run, `setupCompleteFlag === false`) — it hands off
 *      to the SystemCheck view with NO user interaction (proves the
 *      Zustand uiStore + the setup orchestrator run in the renderer).
 *      The first-run handoff deliberately never auto-starts compose,
 *      so this assertion stays deterministic on CI runners that DO
 *      have a Docker daemon.
 *
 * What we INTENTIONALLY do NOT assert:
 *   - Anything past SystemCheck. Docker bootstrap, compose up,
 *     migrations, wizard, unlock — all of those require either a
 *     real Docker daemon or a bypass hook that doesn't exist yet
 *     (Codex S2 turn 2). A real E2E for those screens is a separate
 *     decision, tracked under #13 follow-ups + task #9.
