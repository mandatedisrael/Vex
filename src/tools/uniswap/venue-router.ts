/**
 * Swap VENUE ROUTER policy — single ownership.
 *
 * Given a chain, returns the ordered list of swap venues Vex should use, primary
 * first. This is the ONE place the priority policy lives so the mutating `swap`
 * alias router, the read-only `swap_quote` router, and the agent-facing routing
 * guidance can never drift apart. Flipping priority (or adding a venue) is a
 * change HERE and nowhere else.
 *
 * Policy (Wave 2, owner decision #2):
 *   - KyberSwap-supported EVM chains → [kyberswap (primary), uniswap (fallback)].
 *   - Robinhood Chain 4663 (no Kyber) → [uniswap] (the only venue).
 *   - Any EVM chain Uniswap also covers gets uniswap as a fallback option.
 * Kyber stays primary wherever it is supported, so existing Kyber flows are
 * byte-identical; Uniswap is additive.

// completion of the locked intent: when KyberSwap is the PRIMARY venue but its
// quote FAILS at runtime, the alias retries the quote on Uniswap where a verified
// deployment exists. This module owns BOTH halves of that policy so it can never
// scatter: (a) which chains have a Uniswap fallback, (b) which failures are
// fallback-eligible.

 * TRANSPORT / API / route-level failures: a KyberSwap API timeout, 5xx, network
 * drop, rate-limit, or "no route found" (all thrown from the aggregator client,
 * surfaced as one of these categories).
 *
 * A honeypot / token-safety verdict is NEVER in this set — and structurally can
 * never reach it: the KyberSwap quote surfaces token safety on a SUCCESSFUL quote
 * (verdict recorded, `success: true`), it does NOT throw. So the fallback can
 * only ever fire on a genuine quote FAILURE and can never launder a safety block.
 * `auth` / `unknown` are excluded (a config/opaque failure is surfaced, not
 * silently re-routed).
