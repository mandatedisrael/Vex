/**
 * Façade-surface guard for the wake-executor structural split (A-020).
 *
 * `src/vex-agent/engine/wake/executor.ts` was split into nested modules under
 * `./executor/` (deps, tick, claimed, auto-retry, provider) while the original
 * path stays a compatibility façade + lifecycle owner. This test pins the EXACT
 * public runtime surface so a later edit cannot silently drop, rename, or add an
 * export. The tick behavior is covered by `executor.test.ts`; here we assert
 * presence + runtime typeof + the exact export-key set, that type-only imports
 * of the exported types compile, and a CODEX-EXTRA fake-timer lifecycle guard
 * proving the self-scheduling setTimeout chain never overlaps an in-flight tick
 * and that stop() clears the pending timer + drains the active tick.
