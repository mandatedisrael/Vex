/**
 * `readMissionErrorSignal` — own-property + shape-validation coverage.
 *
 * Two properties this reader must guarantee (BLOCKER 1, fix-wave):
 *   - own-properties ONLY — a value inherited from the prototype chain
 *     (e.g. `Error.prototype.name`) must never be misread as an
 *     attacker/provider-attached signal.
 *   - `causeCode` is shape-validated (errno-shaped:
 *     `/^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{2,59}$/`) because it is persisted into mission
 *     evidence / bug-report context — arbitrary prose must never reach a
 *     persisted record under this field.
