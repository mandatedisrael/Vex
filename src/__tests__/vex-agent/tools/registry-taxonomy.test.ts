/**
 * Action taxonomy — registry coverage + pinned classifications.
 *
 * Puzzle 5 phase 1A (2026-05-23): every internal `ToolDef.actionKind` must
 * be REQUIRED + declared at registration time. The compiler enforces the
 * field's presence on `ToolDef`; this suite enforces:
 *
 *  1. Every registered tool's `actionKind` is a member of `ACTION_KINDS`
 *     (no string drift between the type union and the runtime list).
 *  2. The list (`ACTION_KINDS`) and the union (`ActionKind`) cover the same
 *     7 values — `assertExhaustiveActionKind` would surface a missing branch
 *     at compile time; this test pins both directions.
 *  3. Critical mappings agreed in the puzzle 5/1A Codex review stay stable
 *     (regression guard for "someone reclassified wallet_send_confirm").
 *
 * The full per-tool mapping is in `src/vex-agent/tools/registry/*.ts`; this
 * test does NOT enumerate every tool because the type system already enforces
 * each new tool to declare `actionKind`. It pins ONLY the security/policy-
 * relevant decisions where a silent reclassification would change phase 2+
 * approval behavior.
 *
 * Phase 1B will add `actionKind` to `ProtocolToolManifest` and replace the
 * `deriveProtocolActionKind` heuristic in `protocols/runtime.ts` with a
 * direct field read — at that point a separate test file will pin per-protocol
 * mappings (e.g. polymarket.bridge → user_wallet_broadcast).
