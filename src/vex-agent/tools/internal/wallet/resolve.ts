/**
 * Engine wallet resolution (puzzle 5 phase 5B). Bridges the per-session
 * `WalletResolution` + `WalletPolicy` (threaded via context) to the shared
 * inventory resolvers, and enforces mission scope.
 *
 * Two entry points, deliberately split (Codex stage-5B review):
 *   - `resolveSelectedAddress` — address-only, NEVER decrypts a key. For
 *     wallet_read / send prepare / balance display.
 *   - `resolveSigningWallet` — decrypts the key. ONLY after the approval gate
 *     and immediately before broadcast (wallet_send_confirm executors).
 *
 * Both validate the session selection (id + address snapshot, via
 * `resolveSelectedEntry`) AND the mission wallet policy. Mission policy is NOT
 * gated on `sessionKind` — it rides the explicit `WalletPolicy` so a subagent
 * (sessionKind "agent") still inherits the parent mission's allowed set.
