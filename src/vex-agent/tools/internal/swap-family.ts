/**
 * Swap family + venue classifier — shared between the READ-ONLY `swap_quote`
 * alias and the MUTATING `swap` alias router.
 *
 * One classifier, one source of truth: both aliases route by `chain` to the same
 * family AND the same venue, so the read-only quote and the execute can never
 * disagree — if they did, the prequote gate's venue-bound match-hash would never
 * collide between the quote and the execute. The venue policy itself lives in the
 * VENUE ROUTER (`@tools/uniswap/venue-router`); this classifier just projects it
 * into the shape the aliases dispatch with.
 *
 * Pure helper: only local/no-network resolvers are consulted. No wallet, DB, or
 * privileged imports.
