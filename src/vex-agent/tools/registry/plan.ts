/**
 * Plan-mode tool — a single idempotent `plan_write` (per Anthropic "fewer,
 * better tools"; no read tool because the active plan is auto-injected into the
 * prompt every turn, so a read would only re-surface in-context content).
 *
 * Visible whenever session-scoped plan-mode is ON (`requiresPlanMode`) — i.e.
 * agent sessions, mission setup (so the plan is co-authored alongside the
 * contract and accepted together), and active mission runs.
 *
 * `mutating: false` (co-authoring the plan must not deadlock on per-call
 * approval — mirrors `mission_draft_update`). The real safety
 * gate is the dispatcher's execution gate: while plan-mode is on and the plan
 * is unaccepted, side-effecting tools are blocked until the user accepts.
