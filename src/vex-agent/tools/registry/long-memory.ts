/**
 * Long-term memory tools (memory v2) — the agent-facing write-door into
 * cross-session candidate memory.
 *
 * `long_memory_suggest` is the ONLY agent-facing write tool in the v2 memory
 * system (S2). It STAGES a candidate — it does NOT write memory directly — and
 * an async manager (S4) reviews, dedupes, and decides promotion. Namespaced
 * `long_memory_*` to stay distinct from per-session `memory_*` and the legacy
 * `knowledge_*` surface (which stays live until the S9 cutover).
 *
 * Classification rationale (memory-system/s2-plan.md §3):
 * - `mutating: false` — a LOCAL candidate write, NOT an approval-gated external
 *   mutation. `mutating: true` would wrongly trigger approval in restricted
 *   sessions (the dispatcher's internal mutating-approval gate); session-memory
 *   local-writes use `mutating: false` for the same reason.
 * - `pressureSafety: "mutating"` — still blocked at barrier/critical so the
 *   agent does not suggest while compaction is urgent.
 * - `actionKind: "local_write"` — a Vex-local DB write (candidate staging).
 * - `visibility: {}` — always visible in every session context.
 *
 * The three READ tools (S3) — `long_memory_search` / `long_memory_get` /
 * `long_memory_history` — are the cross-session RECALL door. All are
 * `mutating:false`, `pressureSafety:"read_only"`, `actionKind:"read"`,
 * `visibility:{}` (always visible — unlike session memory's
 * `requiresSessionMemory` gate). `long_memory_search` hides its strategy
 * (vector + dual-trace + rerank); fresh un-consolidated candidates surface as
 * de-weighted soft signals (`notConsolidated:true`), never as fact.

      // WHAT
      "Propose a durable, cross-session LESSON for long-term memory — a trading insight, a strategy/risk lesson, a stable user preference, or a project fact or constraint. Write title and summary in English (embedding retrieval is significantly stronger on English).",
      // HOW IT WORKS
      "This does NOT write memory directly. It STAGES a candidate; an async manager later reviews it, dedupes it, and decides whether to promote it into long-term memory. You get back a candidateId and status, not a stored memory.",
      // DO NOT (steering — reject policy advertised so you rarely trip it)
      "Never include secrets (keys, seeds, API tokens) — a candidate carrying one is REJECTED and nothing is stored. Do NOT record live values (current balances, prices, gas, amounts, open quotes) — memory is for the durable LESSON, not the snapshot, and a candidate that reads as live state is REJECTED. Persisted memory text is English-only: a candidate whose title/summary/content does not read as English is REJECTED — translate the durable lesson into English and re-suggest. Wallet and transaction addresses are auto-masked, so the lesson survives without the raw value.",
      // EVIDENCE
