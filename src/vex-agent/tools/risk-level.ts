/**
 * Risk level — severity classifier orthogonal to `ActionKind`.
 *
 * Plan: agents_dm/plan-integration/05-approvals-wallet-policy.md §"Approval DB model".
 *
 * Puzzle 5 phase 2 (this commit). Risk level is what approval / wallet /
 * audit policy uses to decide HOW urgent / impactful a pending action is;
 * action kind is WHAT KIND of side effect it produces. The two are
 * separate axes — adding a new chain mutation tool (`user_wallet_broadcast`)
 * is `high` risk; a knowledge write (`local_write`) is `low`; a
 * documents delete (`destructive`) is `critical`.
 *
 * The mapping below is the puzzle 5 phase 2 Codex GREEN LIGHT (2026-05-23):
 *   - `read`                     → "info"      (no side effect)
 *   - `local_write`              → "low"       (Vex-local DB/file)
 *   - `schedule`                 → "low"       (deferred execution, no immediate effect)
 *   - `approval_prepare`         → "medium"    (signals incoming confirm with real effect)
 *   - `external_post`            → "medium"    (off-chain mutation: CEX order, social post)
 *   - `user_wallet_broadcast`    → "high"      (user-signed on-chain action)
 *   - `provider_action_request`  → "high"      (provider-funded action, backend signer)
 *   - `destructive`              → "critical"  (no expand-and-contract recovery)
 *
 * Risk level is ORDERED for policy gates (e.g. "block at risk_level >= high
 * when permission=restricted"). The order is the array order below.

 * table has `action_kind NOT NULL` with CHECK constraint — if the dispatcher
 * ever returns `pendingApproval: true` without a stamped `actionKind`, the
 * enqueue site MUST fail fast (Codex 2/1B ruling): an approval intent
 * cannot be persisted with an unknown action.
