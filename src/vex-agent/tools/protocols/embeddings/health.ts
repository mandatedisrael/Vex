/**
 * Tool-embeddings health check.
 *
 * Used by the eval runner before dense baseline capture and by latency/smoke
 * tests. NOT called from `discoverProtocolCapabilities` — the dense leg already
 * degrades gracefully via `denseFailed: true` on empty or mismatched rows. This
 * is a pre-flight gate for test/eval paths where a misconfigured table should
 * fail loudly rather than silently produce zero dense hits.
 *
 * Three conditions checked, in order:
 *   1. Config is loadable (throws from `loadEmbeddingConfig()` if env vars
 *      are missing).
 *   2. `tool_embeddings` has at least one row for the CURRENT generation —
 *      the (provider-reported model, dim) pair, not raw config — no rows
 *      means the table was never populated or was populated under a different
 *      generation. Operator fix: `pnpm tool-reembed`.
 *   3. Row count for that generation is not fewer than the expected active
 *      tool count — stale table means some manifests changed without a
 *      reembed. Operator fix: `pnpm tool-reembed`.
 *
 * GENERATION, not raw config.model, defines "current". Rows are stamped by
 * `reembed.ts` with the model name the PROVIDER reports (providers alias model
 * names) and the dim it actually returns — see `reembed.ts`'s generation probe
 * and `client.ts`'s `providerModel` doctrine. This preflight probes the
 * provider once the same way (`embedTool` schema probe) so its count predicate
 * matches exactly what the reconcile wrote. Counting by raw `config.model`
 * would report a false "empty" whenever the provider aliases the model name.
