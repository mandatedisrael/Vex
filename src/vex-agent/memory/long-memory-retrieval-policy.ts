/**
 * Long-memory RETRIEVAL policy (S3) — pure TS scoring, blend, and dual-trace
 * ranking. No DB, no embeddings, no I/O. Tested as plain unit tests.
 *
 * S3 surfaces TWO retrieval sources in ONE ranked list:
 *   - `long_memory`     — a promoted `knowledge_entries` row (the canonical
 *                         lesson). Scored by the existing knowledge `rerank`
 *                         BASE score × a SOURCE-TIER weight (so inferred /
 *                         hypothesis entries rank LOWER without being excluded —
 *                         genesis §951).
 *   - `memory_candidate` — a fresh `not_consolidated` dual-trace candidate.
 *                         Scored as `similarity × CANDIDATE_DUAL_TRACE_WEIGHT`
 *                         with NO boosts, gated by a minimum similarity and
 *                         capped — a SOFT signal, never a hard constraint
 *                         (genesis §247-272, §260).
 *
 * The two sources are scored by SEPARATE scorers (R1-#1): candidates are NEVER
 * pushed through the knowledge `rerank` (it drops non-`active` rows and assumes
 * numeric ids). The hard invariant `CANDIDATE_DUAL_TRACE_WEIGHT <
 * SOURCE_SOFT_WEIGHT ≤ 1` with candidates carrying no boosts GUARANTEES a
 * confirmed knowledge entry always outranks a candidate at equal raw similarity
 * (R1-#2). A much-higher-similarity fresh candidate may still surface.
