/**
 * Long-memory suggest policy — pure deterministic system-field derivation for

 *
 * S2 stamps ONLY safe, deterministic values on an accepted candidate and defers
 * every nuanced judgement to the stages that consume them:
 *   - the authoritative `source` / `sensitivity` tier is re-derived by the async
 *     manager (S4) from the full transcript — the boundary uses a conservative
 *     floor here (memory-system/s2-plan.md §0 D-B / D-D);
 *   - HOW a not-consolidated candidate is surfaced / weighted is owned by the
 *     dual-trace reader (S3); S2 only sets the bounded TTL upper limit (D-C).
 *
 * Pure module: constants + total functions over primitives. No DB, no
 * embeddings, no I/O — unit-tested in isolation.
