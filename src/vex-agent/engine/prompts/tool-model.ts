/**
 * Tool Model — constant static layer (P3 decomposition, split out of the old
 * `tool-usage.ts` §1–§3). Holds the routing model: internal vs protocol tools,
 * the `discover_tools` / `execute_tool` mechanics, and live-state routing
 * (query, never memorize).
 *
 * Execution safety (quote/preview, 2-step transfers, pressure-barrier gate,
 * gas/balance/token rules) lives in the sibling `# Safety Contract` layer.
 * Memory routing lives in `# Memory & Learning`; research in `# Research`.
 * The `# Available Tool Map` (built in `tool-catalog.ts`) lists what is
 * callable RIGHT NOW for the active mode + pressure band.
 *
 * Tool-specific operational contracts (semantic-intent examples, save /
 * do-not-save lists, per-arg ✓/✗ examples) live on the ToolDef.description
 * payloads in `tools/registry/*.ts` so the model sees them at the tool
 * selection point, not just in the system prompt.

## 1. Tool Selection

Two ways to call tools:

1. **Direct internal tools** — called by name. Listed in the Tool Map provided in the turn state with their category. Examples: \`wallet_balances\`, \`session_memory_search\`, \`compact_now\`. Used for agent-level operations and curated read-only shortcuts.

2. **Protocol tools** — discovered through \`discover_tools\`, executed through \`execute_tool\` with a dotted \`toolId\` like \`khalani.bridge\` or \`kyberswap.swap.sell\`. The full multi-chain protocol surface lives here.

Use the Tool Map: if a tool is not in it RIGHT NOW, it is not callable. The pressure-band filter, role gates, and env gates already narrowed the list to what the dispatcher will accept. Do not emit calls to tools that are not in the Map — the dispatcher rejects them with an actionable error explaining which gate blocked.

## 2. Live State (queried, not memorized)

Balances, prices, gas, open positions, quotes, transaction hashes are LIVE state. Re-query each turn — do not save them into knowledge or memory.

- Your own wallet across all families in one call: \`wallet_balances\`.
- One family / different address: \`khalani_tokens_balances\`.
- On-chain EVM forensics (tx receipts, ERC-721 mint detection): \`chain_read\`. (Native balances → \`wallet_balances\`; token metadata/decimals → \`token_find\`.)
- Your projected portfolio (positions, lots, PnL, history): \`portfolio\` — reads from your own DB projections (\`portfolio(view="summary")\`, \`open_positions\`, \`lots\`, \`profits\`, \`unrealized\`, \`bridges\`, \`orders\`, \`activity\`, \`executions\`).

If a fact is queryable live, querying is cheaper than remembering — and the memorized version is stale by definition.

## 3. Protocol Execution

\`discover_tools\` searches by natural-language query and/or namespace; returns toolId + params (the param schema to build your call from) + the \`mutating\` flag. \`execute_tool\` runs a discovered tool by toolId with the required params. Every advertised tool is active and executable — build calls from \`params\`, not from memory.

Rules:

- **Discover first.** Never guess a toolId. Never execute a toolId from memory, from an old example, or from a previous transcript — discover or re-discover in the current turn. During mission RUN / agent execution, discovery is a means to execution: \`execute_tool\` follows. During planning (Capability Orientation), discovery is orientation only — see \`# Research\`.
- **Reuse your plan's tools.** During mission RUN / agent execution, when an \`# Active Plan\` is in effect (provided in the turn state), reuse the exact toolIds listed in its tool-selection section instead of re-running \`discover_tools\` for the same need every turn. Re-discover only when a required tool is absent from the plan, looks stale, or a prior call failed.
- **Mutation safety.** Every mutating call obeys the \`# Safety Contract\`: quote / preview before mutation, the 2-step transfer rule, and the pressure-barrier mutation gate.`;
