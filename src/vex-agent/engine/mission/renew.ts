/**
 * Mission renewal — clone a completed/accepted mission into a fresh
 * draft for the same session.
 *
 * Codex direction: `renewMission` REQUIRES an explicit
 * `previousMissionId`. The renderer's Renew control is the only place
 * that's allowed to auto-resolve "latest terminal accepted mission" →
 * explicit id (via `mission.getRenewableSource`) before calling this
 * engine helper. Engine never auto-finds.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *
 *   - source mission must belong to the same session (no
 *     cross-session renewal)
 *   - source must have `accepted_contract_hash IS NOT NULL` (you can
 *     only renew a contract that the user actually accepted)
 *   - source's last `mission_run` must be in a terminal status
 *     (`completed`, `failed`, `stopped`, `cancelled`). A still-active
 *     run means the contract is live; the user should stop it first.
 *   - target session must have no active/paused mission run (renewal
 *     adds a fresh draft; one mission per session at a time)
 *   - the new row clones every contract field (goal, constraints,
 *     stop conditions, allow-lists, capital, risk, success criteria)
 *     but resets:
 *       - id (new uuid)
 *       - status → 'draft'
 *       - acceptance four-tuple → NULL
 *       - approved_at → NULL
 *       - timestamps → NOW()
 *       - renewed_from_mission_id → source mission id
 *
 *   - NEVER starts a run. Phase 4's `startMission` requires the user
 *     to click `Accept contract` first.
 *
 * Idempotency: renew is intentionally NOT idempotent — clicking the
 * button twice creates two separate draft rows. The renderer should
 * gate the action (button disables after first click + invalidates
 * the mission query); engine-side dedup would require a token the
 * UI doesn't carry today.
