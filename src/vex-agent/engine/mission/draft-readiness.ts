/**
 * Draft readiness reconciler — the ONE-WAY `draft` → `ready` promotion.
 *
 * Before this module, the only draft→ready transition was the model-patch
 * path (`applyMissionPatch` in `./setup.ts`), which fires only when the
 * model sends a `mission_draft_update` patch. A renewed clone or an
 * edited-and-resaved mission that is ALREADY complete produces no patch,
 * so it never promotes — the badge shows "Preparing" forever (issue #41).
 * This is the reconciliation call every draft-producing write site makes
 * right after it writes `status = 'draft'`.
 *
 * One-way and status-guarded: NEVER demotes `ready` → `draft` (that stays
 * `setup.ts`'s job — an edit can clear a previously-ready field) and
 * NEVER promotes an invalid draft. Status is not a security gate:
 * `ACCEPTABLE_MISSION_STATUSES` (`acceptance.ts`) already accepts
 * `'draft'` for contract acceptance, so promoting a complete draft to
 * `'ready'` only changes what the operator sees, not what they can do.

 * clone insert and the readiness check commit atomically. Omit it to have
 * this function open its own transaction and lock the row itself — the
 * shape every call site outside an existing tx needs (`abort.ts`,
