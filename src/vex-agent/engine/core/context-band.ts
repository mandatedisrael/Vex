/**
 * Context-usage band — classification of prompt pressure relative to the
 * provider's context window. Drives:
 *   - tool-surface projection (the LLM-visible catalog is narrowed to
 *     `safe_at_barrier` + `read_only` + `compact_only` once band reaches
 *     `barrier`),
 *   - dispatcher hard-deny on mutating tools at barrier+,
 *   - the runtime forced-fallback compact at `critical` (when the agent
 *     fails to call `compact_now` itself),
 *   - the system-prompt context-pressure banner.
 *
 * Band is derived from the lagging `sessions.token_count` (the previous
 * prompt's token count, set by `executeTurn` after each completion). This
 * is one turn behind the real pressure, but it's the only signal available
 * before the next provider call — projecting token count pre-prompt would
 * require running the tokenizer, which is out of scope.
 *
 * Thresholds come from `memory/policy.ts` so the policy layer owns the
 * single source of truth. `contextLimit <= 0` is treated as a degenerate
 * config (no meaningful pressure) → always `"normal"`. Prevents
 * division-by-zero.
