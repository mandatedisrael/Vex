/**
 * `/retry` engine entry point.
 *
 * Re-enters the active mission run after a recoverable pause:
 *   - `paused_error` → provider error or other throw inside the runner;
 *     the operator wants to re-attempt once the issue is resolved.
 *   - `paused_wake`  → wake hasn't fired yet; the operator wants to skip
 *     the delay and resume immediately.
 *
 * Refuses (with explicit hint) for:
 *   - `paused_approval` → operator must `/approve` or `/reject` first.
 *   - `running`         → loop already in progress; nothing to retry.
 *   - no active run     → nothing to retry.
 *
 * Race safety (puzzle 03): the lease + status + pending-wake cleanup
 * are committed in a SINGLE `claimRunLeaseAndFlipToRunning` transaction
 * (codex review acceptance). If the claim fails (`lease_busy` /
 * `status_mismatch`) the run + wakes stay untouched, so a failed retry
 * can't strand the session in a partial state.
