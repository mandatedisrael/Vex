# Vex

**Your keys. Your machine. Your agent.**

A self-custodial, autonomous on-chain crypto agent for the desktop. It holds
*your* keys locally and acts on-chain on your terms, not a custodian's.

## What it is

Vex is a desktop app that runs an autonomous crypto agent right next to your
wallet, and the wallet is *yours*. Keys are generated and stored on your own
machine, encrypted at rest, and never leave it. The agent can research markets
and take real on-chain actions (swaps, transfers, and more), but by default
every fund-moving move is gated behind an explicit human approval. No custodian
holds your assets. No server signs for you.

Think "a quant that lives on your laptop, asks before it spends, and can't run
off with the bag."

## Highlights

- **Self-custody, for real.** EVM + Solana keys created and kept locally. Signing authority never leaves the privileged process.
- **Approval-gated by default.** The agent proposes; you approve. State-changing actions don't execute just because a model asked.
- **Encrypted at rest.** Vault secured with AES-256-GCM + scrypt; the master password lives only in memory and is never written to disk.
- **Local memory.** Conversation, knowledge, and embeddings in a local Postgres + pgvector store. Your context stays on your box.
- **Hardened desktop.** Sandboxed renderer, strict CSP, locked IPC boundary between the UI and anything that touches keys.
- **Cross-platform.** macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel) and Linux at launch; Windows to follow.
